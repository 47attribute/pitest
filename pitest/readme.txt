PIT is largely the original work of Henry Coles, but includes the following code from third party sources. 

* A line coverage implementation derived from http://code.google.com/p/javacoveragent/  (Apache 2 licensed).
* A base64 encoding implementation by Robert Harder (public domain)
* A memory efficient hashmap implementation by Google inc (Apache 2 licensed)

The following people have also contributed to the PIT codebase

Stefan Pendorf - Improved inline consts mutator, member variable mutator and numerous code improvements
Nicolas Rusconi - Ant Task
Aidan Morgan - Support for configuration files
Struan Kerr-Liddell - Improvements to html report

Although PIT does not incorporate any code from the Jumble project (http://jumble.sourceforge.net/), the Jumble codebase was used as a guide when developing
some aspects of PIT.
